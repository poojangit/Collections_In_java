//todo ------------HASH SET------------------

//^ Hash set is a pre-defined class present in java.util package.
//^ Hash set was introduced from JDK 1.2
//^ The initial capacity of hash set is 16.
//^ the load factor/ fill ratio of hash set is 0.75 or 75%
//^ The underlining data structure of hash set is Hash Table.

//^ Hash set implements 
//! set
//! clonable
//! serializable

//^ the constructors present in hash table are
//! HashSet()
//! HashSet(int initialCapacity)
//! HashSet(int initialCapacity, float loadFactor)
//! HashSet(Constructor c)

//^ Key features
//! Hash set does not allow dublicate elements
//! It does not maintain the order of execution
//! Allows one null value
//! It offers constant time performance for add, remove and contains
//! Thread safe : not synchronized

//^ Methods used in Hashset
//! add()
//! remove()
//! clear()
//! isEmpty()
//! contains()
//! size()
//! interator()
